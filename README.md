A Collection of Tools for Twitch Streaming

(1) a real-time emotion classifier using a video feed, with a nice graphic.

(2) a now-playing spotify tool, that polls spotify for the current song and writes it to a text file OBS can monitor.

(3) a tool to monitor incoming texts on Apple devices, generate a PDF of them, push it to a USB-connected ReMarkable tablet, allow handwritten response, OCR that response, and send it.  This will also print incoming receipts to a receipt printer.  Still in development.

(4) a tool to connect to Twitch Chat, post random prompts to chat every couple of seconds, log all chats, and monitor for specific commands that users will submit.  The most recent of these commands will appear in currentChatWindow.txt for inclusion in OBS.

(5) a video diary tool that simple advances through a list of topics, timestamping each click with json.  The last click downloads the timestamp json file.  This website needs to be hosted (use python3 -m http.server).
